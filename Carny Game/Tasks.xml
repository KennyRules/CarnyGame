			<Choice choice="Yes" hoursMod="">
				<Text character="">Great! Let's get started.</Text>
				<Text character="">Here is the map. You can travel to various cities, bringing amusement to them and profit to you.</Text> 
				<Text character="">The year is 1930 and the economy is in trouble. People need some escape from their own hardships and that is where you come in!</Text> 
				<Text character="">You have been given a season to make a name for yourself in the carnival business.</Text> 
				<Text character="">Select a town to gather some info about it and click ‘travel’ to head out!</Text>
				<Text character="">This is your carnival. As the owner, your day will be filled with various tasks that need completing, from attracting customers to tidying up the attractions.</Text>
				<Text character="">However, you only have 10 hours of operation to complete tasks in! When there is a task that needs doing, an icon will appear over that section of the carnival.</Text>
				<Text character="">Select that quadrant to determine what needs doing and an estimate on how long it will take.</Text>
				<Text character="">At the end of the day, you will receive a report for the expenses and profits of the day.</Text>
				<Text character="">Your employees require compensation and will individually generate profit for you each day. </Text>
				<Text character="">Additionally, the carnival does require overall maintenance that changes from day to day.</Text>
				<Text character="">If you feel an employee is doing nothing but burning a hole in your pocket, you can use this screen to fire an employee by clicking the red x and confirming the fire.</Text>
				<Text character="">Every day, you can hire local workers to come work for your carnival. Click the ‘hire’ button at the top to see who is available and a brief rundown of their capabilities.</Text>
				<Text character="">Well that's it for the tutorial. Best of luck in managing your carnival!</Text>

		<Text character="Helga">Hey Boss! Look at this mud on my shoe! Now how are supposed to expect crowds if you have so many beefs?</Text>
		<Text character="Owner">Beefs?! What beefs, the season hasn’t even started yet!</Text>
		<Text character="Helga">Yea, but the coyboys have started entering and ruining this place up!</Text>
		<Text character="Owner">*Sigh*...Now what did they do?</Text>
		<Text character="Helga">These cowboys came riding in with bats and started knocking off the ears of the rabbit on the carousel.</Text>
		<Dialog>
			<Choice choice="Try to repair the rabbit" hoursMod="">
				<Text character="Owner">I’ll go see if I can do a quick fix.</Text>
				<Text character="Helga">How do you think you are going to do that with solid wood?</Text>
				<Text character="Owner"> I don’t know yet.  Let me go take a look at it and see what I can do.</Text>
				<Text character="">A little while later...</Text>
				<Text character="Owner">Ok so I can’t fix this one.  Looks like we’ll have to replace it.</Text>
				<Text character="Helga">How about those new fancy metal ones?</Text>
				<Text character="Owner">How in the world are we going to afford that? The season hasn’t even started yet.  I’ll have to go look for an older down at Joe’s place.</Text>
				<Text character="">A few hours later...</Text>
				<Text character="Owner">Well they didn’t have any rabbits, but they had a couple of frogs that we could use to replace them.</Text>
				<Text character="Helga">Frogs gross, who in their right mind would want to ride a frog?</Text>
				<Text character="Owner">Its what they had, that we could afford.  Besides, Mary likes frogs, why wouldn’t other children? Now go fetch a few guys to help me put these things on.</Text>
				<Text character="Helga">Mary is a freak, so I do not think kids will follow her, but if you're lost.</Text>
